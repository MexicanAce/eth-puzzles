Web3 Puzzle Challenges

## What is this repo?

This repo consists a series of puzzle challenges with some web3 on-chain
elements. Each puzzle is different and more of a scratchpad for CTF ideas.

## How do I get started?

All puzzles are located in the `puzzles/` directory. I suggest by starting with
[Puzzle 1](puzzles/puzzle-01/README.md) ðŸ˜…

## Which ethereum chain are these puzzles using?

ZKsync Sepolia Testnet. Here's a link to their docs for connection info:
