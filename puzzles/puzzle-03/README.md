  First, thank you for taking the time to help, I didn't know who else to turn
  to. Now, onto my problem. I've been stuck trying to understand what this
  "hidden" message is that a friend sent my way. They sent me this address to a
  smart contract, but I honestly have no idea what to do from here:
  
  https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/address/0x47964E82281C929119925922A300aDd66bbBe957

  This message was supposed to help us get into the city's super secret speakeasy
  bar this weekend, but they won't let anyone in unless you know the passphrase.

  Can you help me figure it out?

  THANK YOU THANK YOU

  P.S. I overheard someone say that the passphrase is 3 words... GAH, why
  couldn't they just tell me the answer instead?!?!
