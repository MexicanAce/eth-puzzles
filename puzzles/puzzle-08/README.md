Welcome detective! We've been running into a problem in our latest investigation
into the Southtown Crime Syndicate, and we need your help.

We know they're up to something, but can't figure out what their next move is.
We've got an informant on the inside and all we've received is a screenshot of
their office's Print Queue.

Something doesn't add up here, can you take a look and see if you see anything
that stands out?

From previous behaviour, we suspect their next scheme will have 3 words. Find
these 3 words and we might just crack this case wide open!
