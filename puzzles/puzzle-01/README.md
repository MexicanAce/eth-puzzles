## üë©‚Äçüç≥ Chef in Distress

You're at a local diner and excited to order your favourite meal, Salmon!

You pull up a seat and ask the chef to prepare a plate of their finest Salmon, 
but you notice they are not quite themselves.

In response, they drop a small note in front of you and while heading back to
the kitchen they say:

"You know, some people don't like raw salmon... I prefer mine <i>GRILLE-D</i>"

As you look down and unfold the note, it reads:

> Together we must explore the liMits and leave a path

On the back of the note, it reads:

> `function decoder() returns (string memory)` @ [0xa3C8C4ED919Ad50e06c0B52a434DEC69DA1fde17](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/address/0xa3C8C4ED919Ad50e06c0B52a434DEC69DA1fde17)
